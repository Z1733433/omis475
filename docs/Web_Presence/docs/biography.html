                      <h2>My Life</h2>
                      <p>I was born on December 1st 1995 in the state capitol of Illinois, Springfield. This is where I was rasied by my mother, Shanna Frank. She also has a page on this websiter <a href="family.html">here.</a>
                      Springfield was a fairly large town an of course is mostly known for the capitol, which was moved there by the famous president Abraham Lincoln. It was a nice place to grow up, however, I eventually moved to a smaller town cclose by called Chatham.
                      We moved to Chatham when I was in my freshman year of high school. The reason we moved was because Chathame had a better education system. It was admittedly hard to become acquainted to a new high school, but I'm not super weird so it wasn't the worst thing in the world.
                      In the end I enjoyed my new high school a lot and made new friends that I am still friends with this day.</p>

                      <h2>My Work</h2>
                      <p>Obtaining my first job was very difficult. I applied to many places in my home town and it just never really went anywhere, until I got my first job at Menards just as I was about to turn 17.
                      The job I started out with was as a cashier. Probably the most boring job I've ever had, but I enjoyed having the money. Soon they moved me to Carry-out, which is the guy who collects the carts from outside and moves them inside.
                      I had other duties such as cleaning and loading people's cars with product, but the main thing I learned was to have a good work ethic. From there I transfered to the Menards in Sycamore, and I was moved up to Sales Associate.
                      This is the job that I've held throughout my college years, but it has changed in many ways. Most notably, I have moved from department to department gaining experience in a lot of different areas of the store.

                      <h2>My Education</h2>
                      <p>I am going to skip over my education before college because, although it was a very prestigious school, I do not think it is very relevant. I started school at Northern Illinois University in 2014 as a Computer Science major.
                      I stayed in this major for a while until I got into the more intense programming classes. I did not really care that much for the lifestyle that came with being a programmer. So, as my grades were not becoming what I wanted to achieve, I switched to Operations Management and Information Systems.
                      I really enjoyed this new major, specifically after getting to the upper level classes, where I began to learn more about what I was interested in, technology.
