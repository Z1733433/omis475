                          This is my mother, Shanna Frank. She was a very good mother to me and I am very appreciative of all that she has done for me. She raised me as a single mom which must have been tough.
                          She has always been there for me and is probably one of the nicest people I know. She can be a bit protective sometimes, but thats understandable. She always has a bright attitude, and is very dorky.

                          This is my Grandmother, Sandra Frank. She was a cool grandmother at times, but could also be very strict. She has also done a lot for me, most notably, she has been funding my college so I do not have to take out loans that require interest, I just have to pay her back. 
                          She has always given me advice, whether it was good or not I do not know, I never really followed what she has said. Who knows how much wisdom I have missed out on for not listeneing to her, oh well!
