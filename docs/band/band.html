        <dt><strong>Alive 2007</strong></dt>
        <dd>Alive 2007 is a special album that contains only live music from the groups "Alive 2007" concert. All songs on the album are remixes of many of the duo's most popular songs put together with masterfull style.</dd>

        <dd>Human after all was the album that brought Daft Punk to the surface, specifically with their hit song <em>Human After All</em>. Although dated, many of the songs are still considered to be some of Daft Punk's finest works.</dd>
